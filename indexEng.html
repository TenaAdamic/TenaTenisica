Mimi clearly saw both options through the tarot cards and helped me see things from a new perspective. After the reading, I felt much more confident in my decision, and I ultimately chose the path that brings me more fulfillment. Thank you, Mimi, for the guidance and for helping me feel more at peace about the future!</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">I went to Mimi because I was going through a rough time in my relationship, and honestly, I didn’t expect tarot to reveal so much. Mimi accurately described how my partner was feeling and what was really behind our disagreements. Through the reading, I understood where we were going wrong and how we could improve our relationship. I was surprised at how precise and helpful everything was. I would recommend everyone contact Mimi if they need clarity in their relationships!</p>

For example, questions regarding precise timeframes, the future of others without their permission, death or serious health conditions, criminal activities, and the results of games of chance or gambling. Tarot is best used for exploring personal decisions, inner guidance, and personal growth, rather than predicting specific future events or resolving ethically sensitive issues.</p>
