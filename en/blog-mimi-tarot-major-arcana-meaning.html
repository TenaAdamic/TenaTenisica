            Why The Major Arcana Is a Fever Dream with a Moral

          <p>
            The Major Arcana is like the main cast of the tarot universe: the
            twenty-two cards everyone remembers, the ones that carry the drama,
            symbolism, and existential one-liners. The rest of the deck, Cups,
            Swords, Wands, Pentacle, they're the supporting roles, the daily
            grind, the "previously on."
          </p>

          <p>
            When you lay out the Major Arcana from the Tarot de Marseille,
            something interesting happens. There's an actual vibe shift halfway
            through, and if you've ever felt like your life suddenly turned from
            a rom-com into a surreal indie film, congratulations: you've lived
            through the same transition the deck describes.
          </p>

          <h2>The First Act: Earthly Business and Human Chaos</h2>

          <p>
            The first half, from The Magician (I) to The Wheel of Fortune (X),
            is all ground-level stuff. These are cards with feet on the floor,
            people and animals doing very human things: working, learning,
            choosing, ruling, screwing up.
          </p>

          <p>
            It starts with The Magician, the show-off with infinite potential,
            that "I can totally do this" energy before you realize you don't
            know what you're doing. Then comes The High Priestess, who's already
            rolling her eyes because she knows exactly how little you know.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Empress shows up radiating abundance, confidence, and possibly
            expensive perfume, followed by The Emperor, who brings structure,
            control, and probably a Google Calendar. Then comes The Hierophant,
            the keeper of rules, tradition, and "how it's always been done."
          </p>

          <p>
            You might start to rebel, and right on cue, The Lovers arrive to
            remind you that choice always comes with consequences. (That cheeky
            angel overhead? That's your conscience, your temptation, or both.)
          </p>

          <p>
            From there, The Chariot screams by: ambition, motion, the
            intoxicating feeling of "I've got this." But pride is a slippery
            steering wheel. Strength follows, and she's not about brute force
            but grace, the quiet confidence that tames the beast instead of
            fighting it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then things start to wobble. The Hermit walks off to figure out why
            the noise suddenly feels unbearable. He finds wisdom, sure, but also
            isolation. Then, just when he starts to make peace with it, The
            Wheel of Fortune spins and the universe shrugs. Up, down, round and
            round. Control is cute while it lasts.
          </p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              That's the first act: human life, cause and effect, ego and
              effort. It's the daylight portion of the journey, the part where
              everything still seems tangible.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>The Second Act: Welcome to the Cosmic Afterparty</h2>

          <p>
            Then, the deck flips. From Justice (XI) to Judgement (XX), things
            getâ€¦ weird. The imagery turns dreamy, abstract. Angels drop in like
            celestial influencers, skeletons waltz across the cards, and the
            architecture of reality starts to melt a little around the edges.
            This is where the story leaves the physical world and dives into the
            psyche, the tarot's after-hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            Justice opens the second act like a no-nonsense cosmic accountant,
            reminding you that the bill for Act One is due. Then comes The
            Hanged Man, who decides that maybe hanging upside down for a while
            is the only way to see things clearly. Enlightenment, but make it
            uncomfortable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Death walks in next, and let's get this straight: it's not the
            horror-movie cameo people think it is. Death in tarot is change with
            teeth, transformation without euphemism. Something ends. Something
            else begins. The skeleton doesn't kill; he clears space.
          </p>

          <p>
            After that cleanse comes Temperance, the chill bartender of the
            divine, blending opposites until balance tastes like peace. Then The
            Devil crashes the calm, a reminder that desire, fear, and addiction
            are just chains we clasp ourselves. He's the rock star of the
            Arcana: magnetic, messy, unforgettable.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Tower follows, of course, lightning, collapse, the moment when
            your curated life feed implodes. It's chaos, but also honesty: you
            can't rebuild what's still pretending to stand.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, in the smoldering silence, The Star rises, soft, luminous, the
            fragile hope that always survives the burn. The Moon slinks in next,
            seductive and strange, whispering, "You're not done dreaming yet."
            Reality blurs. Instinct rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Sun bursts in, bright, clear, joyful, like the morning after a
            long internal night. Then Judgement calls: an awakening, not a
            punishment. The trumpet blows, and you realize you've been asleep
            for most of this movie.
          </p>

          <h2>And Finally, The World Spins</h2>

          <p>
            The World (XXI) is the dance at the end of it all, completion,
            integration, the moment you realize the chaos was choreography.
            Everything connects. Everything belongs.
          </p>

          <p>
            And outside all of this, orbiting like a wild satellite, is The Fool
            (0), barefoot, bag slung over his shoulder, dog barking at his
            heels. He's the soul before experience, the wanderer after
            enlightenment, and maybe both at once. He doesn't start the story or
            end it. He is the story, the eternal loop of learning, forgetting,
            and trying again.
          </p>

          <h2>Tarot as the Human Road Trip</h2>

          <p>
            Looked at this way, the Major Arcana isn't a mystical code, it's a
            road trip playlist for the soul. You start ambitious, crash a few
            times, get existential, cry under the stars, rebuild, and eventually
            learn that "arrival" was never the point.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first half is the world of doing; the second is the world of
            being. One's daylight, one's dreamlight. Together, they're the whole
            human mess, divine, ridiculous, and breathtakingly familiar.
          </p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              The Major Arcana reminds you that life is cyclical, not linear.
              Every ending feeds a beginning. Every tower hides a star. Every
              fool, no matter how many times they trip, eventually finds their
              way home, even if it's just to start wandering again.
            </p>
